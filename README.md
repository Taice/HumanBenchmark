# HumanBenchmark cli
- cool human benchmark thing but its TUI
- it also has cool graphs at the end result (straight up ripped from human benchmark)
- also mouse support for the games that it makes sense for
- currently only has the first 7 gamemodes but plans are to add all the minigames

## building
- you'll need cargo (rust)
- just clone the repository and `cargo run --release` to run the program
